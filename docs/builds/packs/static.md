Static Build Packs take the files from your project and create a Docker image with a web server to serve them. This means your final Docker image has a web server ready to display your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Static Build Packs only work if your project is already built (for example, with a static site generator like [Astro ↗](https://astro.build/?utm_source=coolify.io) or [Webstudio ↗](https://webstudio.is/?utm_source=coolify.io)). Once you have the built files, you can upload them to a Git repository and use Coolify to deploy your site.


## How to Use Static Build Pack

### 1. Prepare Your Static Files
First, build your site with your favorite static site generator. This process creates a folder with all the files your site needs (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.).  

Next, upload these static files to a Git repository. You can use [GitHub ↗](https://github.com/?utm_source=coolify.io), [GitLab ↗](https://about.gitlab.com/?utm_source=coolify.io), or any other Git service. For this guide, we will use [GitHub ↗](https://github.com/?utm_source=coolify.io) as an example.


### 2. Create a New Resource in Coolify
On Coolify dashboard open your project and click the **Create New Resource** button.

### 3. Choose Your Deployment Option

**A.** If your Git repository is public, choose the **Public Repository** option.

**B.** If your repository is private, you can select **Github App** or **Deploy Key**. (These methods require extra configuration. You can check the guides on setting up a [Github App ↗](/knowledge-base/git/github/integration#with-github-app-recommended) or [Deploy Key ↗](/knowledge-base/git/github/integration#with-deploy-keys) if needed.)


### 4. Select Your Git Repository
If you are using a public repository, paste the URL of your GitHub repository when prompted. The steps are very similar for all options.

### 5. Choose the Build Pack
Coolify will default to using Nixpacks. Click on the Nixpack option, and then select **Static** from the dropdown menu.

This tells Coolify to build your image with a static web server.


### 6. Set the Base Directory
Enter the path where your static files are located:

<ZoomableImage src="/docs/images/builds/packs/static/5.webp" />

- If your files are in the root of your repository, just type `/`.
- If they are in a subfolder, type the path to that folder (for example, `/out`).


After setting the base directory, click the **Continue** button.


### 7. Choose a Web Server
As of Coolify **v4.0.0-beta.402**, the only web server option available is [Nginx ↗](https://nginx.org/en/?utm_source=coolify.io). So **Nginx** will be selected by default.

### 8. Enter Your Domain
Type the domain name where you want your site to be available.  

<ZoomableImage src="/docs/images/builds/packs/static/7.webp" />

If you have multiple domains, separate them with commas.


### 9. Deploy Your Site
Click the **Deploy** button. The deployment process is usually quick (often less than a minute, depending on your server).

Once the deployment is finished, visit your domain in a browser to see your live site.


### 10. Customize Your Web Server Configuration <Badge type="warning" text="Optional" />
Coolify provides a default web server configuration that works for most cases. 

If you want to change it then click the **Generate** button to load the default settings and make any changes you need.
