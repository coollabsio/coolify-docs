<br />

Nixpacks is a open source build pack created by [Railway](https://railway.com?utm_source=coolify.io) and the source is available on [Github](https://github.com/railwayapp/nixpacks?utm_source=coolify.io). Coolify uses Nixpacks as one of the build pack.

Nixpacks checks your git repository (also called as "**source directory**" in nixpacks) and generates a Dockerfile, then it will build a docker image based on the Dockerfile it generated.

Nixpacks can deploy both fully static websites and non-static applications. Once your repository is set up, you can use Coolify to deploy your project with ease.

## How to use Nixpacks?
On Coolify you can only use Nixpacks on git-based deployments.

### 1. Create a New Resource in Coolify
On Coolify dashboard open your project and click the **Create New Resource** button.

### 2. Choose Your Deployment Option

<ZoomableImage src="/docs/images/builds/packs/nixpacks/2.webp" />

**A.** If your Git repository is public, choose the **Public Repository** option.

**B.** If your repository is private, you can select **Github App** or **Deploy Key**. (These methods require extra configuration. You can check the guides on setting up a [Github App ↗](/knowledge-base/git/github/integration#with-github-app-recommended) or [Deploy Key ↗](/knowledge-base/git/github/integration#with-deploy-keys) if needed.)


### 3. Select Your Git Repository
If you are using a public repository, paste the URL of your GitHub repository when prompted. The steps are very similar for all other options.

### 4. Choose the Build Pack
Coolify will default to using Nixpacks. If it doesn’t, click to select Nixpacks as your build pack.

### 5. Configure Build Pack
We have different options like Base Directory, Publish Directory, and Ports that slightly change based on the application you deploy (static websites/applications). So, below we have two sections for the deployments possible with Nixpacks.
- [How to deploy Fully Static Websites](#how-to-deploy-fully-static-website)
- [How to deploy Non-Static Website/Applications](#how-to-deploy-non-static-website-applications)

## How to deploy Fully Static Website?
First, follow the previous section in this documentation: [How to use Nixpacks](#how-to-use-nixpacks). After that, proceed with the steps below.

<ZoomableImage src="/docs/images/builds/packs/nixpacks/5.webp" />

1. **Branch:** Coolify will automatically detect the branch from your Repostiory.

2. **Base Directory:** Enter the directory Nixpacks should use as the root (for example, `/` if your files are at the root, or a subfolder if applicable).
   - If you have a monorepo then you can enter the path of the directory you want to use as base directory (`/backend` for example)

3. **Is it a static Site?:** Click on this option to enable static mode.

4. **Port:** Once you enabled `Is it a static Site` the port will be automatically set to `80` and cannot be changed. (This is intentional)

5. **Publish Directory:** Once you enabled `Is it a static Site` this publish directory option will visible on the UI. You have to enter the output directory where your static files are generated (commonly `/dist`).

6. Click on **Continue** button once you have set all the above settings to correct details.

7. Choose a web server for your static website

<ZoomableImage src="/docs/images/builds/packs/nixpacks/6.webp" />

- As of Coolify **v4.0.0-beta.404**, the only web server option available is [Nginx ↗](https://nginx.org/en/?utm_source=coolify.io). So **Nginx** will be selected by default.

8. Click the **Deploy** button. The deployment process is usually quick (often less than a minute, depending on your server).


9. Customize Your Web Server Configuration <Badge type="warning" text="Optional" />

<ZoomableImage src="/docs/images/builds/packs/nixpacks/7.webp" />

- Coolify provides a default web server configuration that works for most cases. 

- If you want to change it then click the **Generate** button to load the default settings and make any changes you need.


::: warning HEADS UP!
You have to click on the **Restart** button for the new configuration to take effect.

### How this works?
Nixpacks will build the website using your codebase and create a Docker image with a web server to serve them. This means your final Docker image has a web server ready to serve your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.



## How to deploy Non-Static Website/Applications?
First, follow the previous section in this documentation: [How to use Nixpacks](#how-to-use-nixpacks). After that, proceed with the steps below.

<ZoomableImage src="/docs/images/builds/packs/nixpacks/8.webp" />

1. **Branch:** Coolify will automatically detect the branch from your Repostiory.

2. **Base Directory:** Enter the directory Nixpacks should use as the root (for example, `/` if your files are at the root, or a subfolder if applicable).
   - If you have a monorepo then you can enter the path of the directory you want to use as base directory (`/backend` for example)

3. **Port:** Enter the port where your application listens for incoming requests.

4. **Is it a static Site?:** Leave this unchecked since you’re deploying a non-static application.

5. Click on **Continue** button once you have configured all the above options.

6. After clicking the **Continue** button, you can adjust settings like your domain and environment variables, then click the **Deploy** button to launch your application.


### How this works?
Nixpacks analyzes your codebase, builds a Docker image, and then starts a container using that image.


## Advanced Configuration
### Environment Variables
You can customize Nixpacks' behavior using environment variables. There are many variables available for different application frameworks, and you can find detailed information in their documentation: [Nixpacks Environment Variables](https://nixpacks.com/docs/configuration/environment?utm_source=coolify.io).  

To add or modify environment variables in Coolify, simply click on the **Environment Variables** tab, where you can manage them easily.

### Commands
If needed, you can override the default install, build, and start commands. Simply scroll down to the build section on Coolify and input your custom commands.

::: warning Note:
You may need to include a `nixpacks.toml` file in your repository for these changes to take effect.

### Configuration file
Nixpacks supports specifying build configurations in a nixpacks.toml or nixpacks.json file. If one of these files is present in the root of your repository, it will be automatically used. For more details, refer to the [Nixpacks documentation](https://nixpacks.com/docs/configuration/file?utm_source=coolify.io).


## Known issues and solutions
::: details 1. Outdated Packages/Dependencies
Sometimes, Nixpacks may use older package versions. If you encounter this issue, update the `nixpkgs` archive version in your `nixpacks.toml` file. You can learn more about this in the Nixpacks docs on [nixpkgs archive](https://nixpacks.com/docs/configuration/file#nixpkgs-archive?utm_source=coolify.io)

This is a Nixpacks-related issue, not a Coolify issue. For further assistance, please contact the Nixpacks support team.
