## What is Coolify?
Coolify is a software that makes self-hosting simple and powerful. It lets you run your applications, databases, and services on your own server, whether that’s an old laptop, a Raspberry Pi, or a rented server from a provider like [Hetzner ↗](https://coolify.io/hetzner). 

With Coolify, you get full control over your projects, your data, and your costs. It’s completely free to use, open-source, and has no features locked behind a paywall. 

Think of Coolify as your personal alternative to cloud platforms like [Vercel ↗](https://vercel.com?utm_source=coolify.io), [Railway ↗](https://railway.com/?utm_source=coolify.io), or [Heroku ↗](https://www.heroku.com/?utm_source=coolify.io), but without the huge bills or privacy trade-offs.


## What Coolify Is Not
Coolify isn’t a cloud service that hosts everything for you, you need your own server. That could be your old laptop, a Raspberry Pi, or a rented server from a hosting provider like [Hetzner ↗](https://coolify.io/hetzner), and you’ll need SSH access to use it. 

It’s not a zero-effort solution either, if you choose to self-host, you’ll need to set up your server and install Coolify. But once it’s running, managing your projects becomes very easy.

## Getting Started with Coolify
Before you jump into using Coolify, it’s worth understanding a few key concepts to make your journey smoother. 

Learn about servers, SSH access, and how Coolify manages your projects by checking out our [concepts guide ↗](/get-started/concepts).

You have two ways to use Coolify:
- [Self-Host Coolify](#self-host-coolify)
- [Use Coolify Cloud](#use-coolify-cloud)

---

### Self-Host Coolify
  - Install Coolify on your own server. This requires setting up the server, installing Coolify, and handling updates yourself. 
  - You’ll also need to allocate some server resources to run Coolify. 
  - It’s completely free (except your server bills) and gives you full control over your infrastructure.


### Use Coolify Cloud
  - Let the Coolify team manage Coolify for you. 
  - With Coolify Cloud, you don’t need to install or update Coolify yourself, and no server resources are required for Coolify itself, it runs on the Coolify team’s managed servers. 
  - Simply create an account from [here ↗](https://app.coolify.io/register), connect your servers via SSH keys, and start deploying. 
  This is a paid service (starting at $5/mo), as it costs the team to host and maintain the infrastructure. 
  - Updates on Coolify Cloud are thoroughly tested by the core team, so they might be slightly delayed for added stability.
