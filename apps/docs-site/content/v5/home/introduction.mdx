## What is Coolify?
Coolify is a software that makes self-hosting simple and powerful. It lets you run your applications, databases, and services on your own server, whether that’s an old laptop, a Raspberry Pi, or a rented server from a provider like [Hetzner](https://coolify.io/hetzner). 

With Coolify, you get full control over your projects, your data, and your costs. It’s completely free to use, open-source, and has no features locked behind a paywall. 

Think of Coolify as your personal alternative to cloud platforms like [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=coolify.io), [Railway](https://railway.com/?utm_source=coolify.io), or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/?utm_source=coolify.io), but without the huge bills or privacy trade-offs.

## What Coolify Is Not
Coolify isn’t a cloud service that hosts everything for you, you need your own server. That could be your old laptop, a Raspberry Pi, or a rented server from a hosting provider like [Hetzner](https://coolify.io/hetzner), and you’ll need SSH access to use it. 

It’s not a zero-effort solution either, if you choose to self-host, you’ll need to set up your server and install Coolify. But once it’s running, managing your projects becomes very easy.
