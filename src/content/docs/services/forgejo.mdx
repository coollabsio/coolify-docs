## What is Forgejo?

Forgejo is a self-hosted lightweight software forge. It's easy to install and low maintenance, it just does the job.

## Forgejo Actions Runner

Forgejo has available a first party "actions runner" to [execute task jobs on a repository](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/user/actions/), much like [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) or [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/index.html).

Coolify includes Forgejo services with a single runner, using [Docker-in-Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker) to handle and report task jobs.

Due to the alpha status of the Forgejo runner, rebooting the Forejo application container after the initial setup is required to fully register the shared secret into Forejo for runners to validate:

After sucessfully setting up Forejo, **reboot the `forgejo` service** and wait some seconds until the runner appears in Forgejo _Actions_ Configuration section.

Forejo is also compatible with third-party CI apps and platforms. Forgejo is a Gitea-fork, so instructions to incorporate these CI may be the same for both.
