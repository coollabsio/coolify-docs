## What is Sonatype Nexus

Sonatype Nexus is a repository manager that allows you to store, manage, and distribute your software artifacts.
The official container is for x86_64 architecture. The arm64 version is community maintained and synced with the official repository.

## Setup

- The setup relies on starting as default user "admin" with password "admin123".
- Once the service is running, login with the default credentials and change the password.
- After that, delete `NEXUS_SECURITY_RANDOMPASSWORD=false` line from the compose file and restart the service to apply the changes.

Minimum requirements:
- 4 vCPU
- 3 GB RAM
