## UI Issues

### Slow UI or Pages Not Loading
If you experience slow UI performance or pages not loading properly, this is probably caused by Cloudflare's Rocket Loader feature.

<Aside type="tip">
  Cloudflare Rocket Loader should be disabled generally as it can cause significant issues with Coolify's UI and Coolify's UI performance. 
</Aside>

You can disable Cloudflare Rocket Loader in your Cloudflare dashboard under `Speed` > `Optimization` > `Rocket Loader`.

## Docker Issues

### Expired GitHub Personal Access Token
You might encounter one of these errors:

```bash
Error response from daemon: Head "https://ghcr.io/v2/coollabsio/coolify-helper/manifests/1.0.1": unauthorized: authentication required
```

or

```bash
Unable to find image 'ghcr.io/coollabsio/coolify-helper:latest' locally
docker: Error response from daemon: Head "https://ghcr.io/v2/coollabsio/coolify-helper/manifests/latest": denied: denied
```

These errors indicate that Docker cannot authenticate with the GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io). To resolve this, you can either:

1. Log out of the GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io):
```bash
docker logout ghcr.io
```

2. Or renew your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) if you need to maintain authenticated access for deployments for example.

### Raspberry Pi Crashes
If you are using a Raspberry Pi with only 2GB of RAM, you may experience system crashes even with swap space enabled. This probably occurs because Raspberry PIs often use SD cards which are slower than SSDs and can be unstable.

The solution is to either:
- Upgrade to a modern Raspberry Pi with 4GB+ of RAM, or
- Limit Docker's memory usage by adding the following to your `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file:

```json
{
  "memory": "1.8g"
}
```
